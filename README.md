Client and Server source code/(<i><strong>Echo Server</strong></i>)
<p>The server is created using port number, and the client is created using hostname(string) and port number. Once the client establishes a connection, it sends a message to the server. The server reads the message, and then sends the same thing back. =-]</p>
